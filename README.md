# Face-Recognition-and-Emotion-Detection-System
This project is a Face Recognition and Emotion Detection System built using OpenCV, FER (Facial Emotion Recognition), and Streamlit. The system allows users to capture their faces, train a recognition model, and detect both faces and emotions in real time via a webcam.

# Features
Face Capture: Capture multiple images of a user's face for training.
Face Training: Train the face recognition model using the captured images.
Real-time Recognition and Emotion Detection: Detect and recognize faces along with emotions (such as happiness, sadness, etc.) from live webcam feed.

# Technology Stack
Python
OpenCV: For face detection and recognition.
FER: For detecting emotions from faces.
Streamlit: For creating a web-based user interface.
